1. The power pins for U1 don't have a visible schematic symbol. If they
   really need to be on a separate symbol from the rest of U1, the symbol
   should have some kind of outline.

2. Bypass caps C1 and C2 are a bit oversized. If this product is intended
   to be large enough volume, consider dropping down to 10V caps to lower
   the price.

3. All of those 'D1' reference designators on the ground connections are
   probably unnecessary, and can be perceived as cluttering up the schematic.

4. The refdes for the ground pin on J1 is 'A1'. That's probably accidental.
   Depending on some particulars of the schematic capture tool used, that
   might even unlink J1's ground pin from the actual GND net.

5. J1 could be made clearer by using a single schematic symbol instead of
   one for each pin.

6. The polarity of the DB-9 isn't called out. Is it male? Female?

7. There is no protection on the I2C lines. If this is an internal component
   in a larger system, that might be fine. If this is a customer-facing port,
   it really should have ESD protection (maybe a TVS on each line) and 
   current-limiting resistors or PTCs.

8. There should probably be pullup resistors on the I2C lines, even if the
   device is intended to the an I2C slave.

9. I2C is a pretty weird choice for the communications protocol if this is
   a standalone product. It's OK if this is intended to be a Sparkfun/Adafruit
   -type module, but USB or RS-232 should be considered if it's intended to
   be used by non-engineers.

10. The choice of a DB-9 connector means that somebody's probably going to
    plug it into an RS-232 device at some point. That's pretty likely to 
    fry the SCL line, which is located on a pin that could get +/-15V if
    plugged into an RS-232 DTE.

11. With 4 lines each for the LED row and column selects, there are 8 total
    pins. That's a nice round number, and all of the pins should be put on
    a single MCU 'port', instead of having col<4> on port B and all of the
    rest on port A. Keeping all of the pins on a single GPIO port ensures
    that you can change them all with a single atomic operation. That avoids
    accidental states in-between the update of port A and port B.

12. There are no current-limiting components on any of the LEDs. Considering
    that they're rated for 5mA, they would blow pretty much instantly as
    soon as you powered the system up.

13. The column-select pins are numbered col<1> to col<4> instead of the
    more common col<0> to col<3> syntax.
