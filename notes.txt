1. The power pins for U1 don't have a visible schematic symbol. If they
   really need to be on a separate symbol from the rest of U1, the symbol
   should have some kind of outline.

2. Bypass caps C1 and C2 are a bit oversized. If this product is intended
   to be large enough volume, consider dropping down to 10V caps to lower
   the price.

3. All of those 'D1' reference designators on the ground connections are
   probably unnecessary, and can be perceived as cluttering up the schematic.

4. The refdes for the ground pin on J1 is 'A1'. That's probably accidental.
   Depending on some particulars of the schematic capture tool used, that
   might even unlink J1's ground pin from the actual GND net.

5. J1 could be made clearer by using a single schematic symbol instead of
   one for each pin.

6. The polarity of the DB-9 isn't called out. Is it male? Female?

7. There is no protection on the I2C lines. If this is an internal component
   in a larger system, that might be fine. If this is a customer-facing port,
   it really should have ESD protection (maybe a TVS on each line) and 
   current-limiting resistors or PTCs.

8. There should probably be pullup resistors on the I2C lines, even if the
   device is intended to the an I2C slave.

9. I2C is an uncommon choice for the communications protocol if this is
   a standalone product. It's OK if this is intended to be a Sparkfun/Adafruit
   -type module, but USB or RS-232 should be considered if the product is
   intended to be used by non-engineers.

10. The choice of a DB-9 connector means that somebody's probably going to
    plug it into an RS-232 device at some point. That's pretty likely to 
    fry the SCL line, which is located on a pin that could get +/-15V if
    plugged into an RS-232 DTE.

11. With 4 lines each for the LED row and column selects, there are 8 total
    pins. That's a nice round number, and all of the pins should be put on
    a single MCU 'port', instead of having col<4> on port B and all of the
    rest on port A. Keeping all of the pins on a single GPIO port ensures
    that you can change them all with a single atomic operation. That avoids
    accidental states in-between the update of port A and port B.

12. Without constant-current drivers, the LED brightness isn't going to be
    very precise.

13. There are no current-limiting components on any of the LEDs. Considering
    that they're rated for 5mA, they would blow pretty much instantly as
    soon as you powered the system up.

14. The column-select pins are numbered col<1> to col<4> instead of the
    more common col<0> to col<3> syntax.

15. The forward voltage of those LEDs is pretty high - 3.15V worst-case.
    It's a stretch trying to drive them off of a 3.3V rail without
    current-control ICs. I would recommend switching to an LED family
    with a lower forward voltage or driving the LEDs directly off of the
    12V input rail (with an NMOS level-shifter stage before the PMOS row
    drivers).

16. At the expense of some power efficiency, you could lower your the product's
    costs (both BOM and assembly) by replacing all of the MOSFETs with NPN BJTs,
    which come in array packages. The circuit would work pretty much the same
    way, except that the LEDs would be inverted because the row-driver polarity
    would change. This would need to be accompanied by running the LEDs off of
    the 12V rail in order to make up for the VCE loss across the transistors.

17. A 32-bit ARM MCU might be a bit much for this particular product. You could
    shave a dollar or so off by using a cheaper MCU like an MSP430 or an ATTINY.

18. C3 (the 12V rail's bulk capacitance) is severely underrated. a 16V part isn't
    enough margin to be safe, and the 1uF capacitor is a little weak. I would
    recommend 22uF minimum, rated for 24V.

19. You could replace U2, R9, and R10 with a single fixed-voltage LDO. It would
    save board space and assembly costs, and might wind up having a lower BOM
    cost as well.

20. It's good practice to include a high-frequency bypass cap in parallel with
    C4 (the LDO's output capacitor). Since you already have 0.1uF bypass caps
    in the design (intended for placement near to the MCU's VDD and Vref pins),
    adding another one next to C4 is very cheap.
